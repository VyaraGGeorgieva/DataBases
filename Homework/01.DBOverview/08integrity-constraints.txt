What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
Integrity constraints are used to ensure accuracy and consistency of data in a relational database. Data integrity is handled in a relational database through the concept of referential integrity. Many types of integrity constraints play a role in referential integrity (RI).
Types: 
Primary Key Constraint – it ensures that a definite column is unique;

Not Null Constraint – ensures that no null values are allowed;
Foreign key constraints – ensures that two keys share a primary key to foreign key relationship;
Data cleanliness - Constraints verify that the data in the data warehouse conforms to a basic level of data consistency and correctness, preventing the introduction of dirty data.
