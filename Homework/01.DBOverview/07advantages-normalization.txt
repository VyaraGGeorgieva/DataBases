What are the advantages of normalized databases?
1) There is no extra data stored, hence less money is to be invested in storage
2) The queries are performed in a faster manner, as there is less data to search through;
3) Data duplication is avoided, hereby – the higher risk for mistakes;
4) Changes are cascaded within the data samples;
5) No data copies are saved, which benefits to memory and space saving again;
