What are transactions used for?
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A logical unit of work must exhibit four properties, called the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties, to qualify as a transaction.
Example:
we have an Account table which represents a Bank Account and we will transfer money from one account to another account

Request: transfer 900$ from Account 9001 to 9002

start transaction
select balance from Account where Account_Number='9001';
select balance from Account where Account_Number='9002';
update Account set balance=balance-900 here Account_Number='9001' ;
update Account set balance=balance+900 here Account_Number='9002' ;
commit; //if all sql queries succeed
rollback; //if any of the Sql queries failed or error
